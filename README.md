# Deep-Learning-Research-Papers
I'm attempting to implement foundationals and important papers in deep learning. For now it's mostly focused on computer vision.

### Papers

- ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Alexnet)  
  https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks

### In progress

- Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks (ZFNet) <br/> 
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901
